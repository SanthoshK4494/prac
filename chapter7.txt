Summary: Chapter 7
Mary Debenham is called into the dining car. Poirot asks why she lied and concealed the fact she was living in the Armstrong house at the time of the murder. Mary admits this is true; she had to hide her true identity so new families would hire her. She was afraid that if people found out she had any connection to the Armstrongs they might not hire her. Mary tells Poirot she did not recognize Countess Andrenyi, three years had passed since she last saw the Countess and she looked much different. Mary breaks down in tears and Colonel Arbuthnot, still in the room, threatens Poirot. The couple leaves the dining car. M. Bouc is, again, astonished at Poirot's abilities, he cannot figure how he knew the Mary worked at the Armstrong house. Poirot tells M. Bouc he knew it was Mary because the Countess tried so hard to protect her. The Countess described her governess as a big, red-haired womanâ€”the exact opposite of Mary. The countess, thinking of Debenham, told Poirot the name of her governess was Freebody.
